 	Scenario: User creates a new Cataloging Record and its hierarchy 
		Given user is on the "Create New" page
		And selects the "Cataloging" radio button on the Create New page
		And clicks on the "Create" button
		And enters "2012.12.1a" in the "Identification Number" field
		And enters "2012.12.1" in the "Broader object" field
		And clicks on the "Create new" button # might not be specific enough
	    And user selects "Word (verso)" from dropdown in "Broader object type" row # I am 90% sure this isn't going to work here
	    And enters "2012.12.1a.1" in the "Object component" field
		And clicks on the "Create new" button # might not be specific enough
		And user selects "Separable part" in the "Object component type"  row # might not work 

		And user clicks the plus to repeat the "Object component" form #needs stepdef ??
		And enters "2012.12.1a.2" in the "Object component" field
		And clicks on the "Create new" button # might not be specific enough	
		And user selects "Separable part" in the "Object component type"  row # might not work 
		And the user saves the record

		# For the following "Thens", they might not be specific enough
		# In the Webpage, there are different rows and I'm not entirely sure how to discriminate amongst them
		# So for Object component stuff, it might not be specific enough, though it should work
		Then the "Broader Object" field should contain "2012.12.1"
		Then the "Object component" field should contain "2012.12.1a.2"
		Then the "Object component" field should contain "2012.12.1a.1"
		Then the "Broader object type" field should contain "Work (verso)" # this might not work
		Then the "Object component type" field should contain "separable part" # this might not work
